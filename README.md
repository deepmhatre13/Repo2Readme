## About the Project

`repo2readme` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to       
automate the creation of high-quality `README.md` files. It
intelligently scans your repository, summarizes key files, and then    
iteratively generates and refines a `README` using advanced AI agents. 
Whether your project is hosted on GitHub or resides locally,
`repo2readme` streamlines documentation, ensuring your projects are    
well-explained and easily understood.

## Tech Stack

The `repo2readme` project leverages a modern Python ecosystem for its  
functionality:

## Key Features

*   **Repository Analysis**: Automatically loads files and content from
GitHub URLs or local directories.
*   **Intelligent Summarization**: Uses a Groq LLM to summarize        
individual source files, capturing their purpose and functionality.    
*   **Hierarchical Tree Generation**: Creates a visual representation  
of your repository's directory structure.
*   **AI-Powered README Creation**: Employs a Google Gemini model to   
draft comprehensive and structured `README.md` content.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: Utilizes an agent-based workflow with a  
reviewer agent (Google Gemini) to iteratively score and improve the    
generated README until a high-quality standard is met.
*   **API Key Management**: Securely stores and manages API keys for   
Groq and Google Gemini services in your local environment.
*   **File Filtering**: Automatically ignores common development       
artifacts (`.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, etc.) to focus on    
relevant project files.

## Installation

To install `repo2readme`, you need Python 3.10 or higher.

1.  **Clone the repository (optional, if installing from source):**    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/agsaru/repo2readme.git
    cd repo2readme
    ```

2.  **Install the package:**
    ```bash
    pip install repo2readme
    ```

## Usage

`repo2readme` provides two main commands: `run` to generate a README   
and `reset` to clear your stored API keys.

### 1. Generate a README

Use the `run` command with either a GitHub repository URL or a local   
path.

**From a GitHub Repository URL:**
```bash
repo2readme run --url https://github.com/agsaru/repo2readme -o README_NEW.md
```

**From a Local Repository Path:**
```bash
repo2readme run --local ./path/to/your/repo -o README_LOCAL.md
```

**Options:**
*   `-u`, `--url <URL>`: GitHub repository URL to process.
*   `-l`, `--local <PATH>`: Path to a local repository.
*   `-o`, `--output <FILE_PATH>`: File path to save the generated README (defaults to `README.md`).
*   `-f`, `--force`: Overwrite the output file and bypass the token estimation confirmation prompt without confirmation.
*   `--dry-run`: Preview the analysis without making any API calls (runs local analysis, generates the repository tree, estimates token count, and prints the list of files to be processed).

### 🛡️ Token Estimation and Warnings

Running the tool on a repository can consume a significant number of LLM API tokens. To prevent accidental quota exhaustion and unexpected costs:

1. **Before any API calls are made**, `repo2readme` estimates the number of files, token count, and total request size.
2. If running interactively, the tool displays this analysis and prompts the user for confirmation:
   ```
   Repository Analysis

   Files to summarize : 45
   Estimated tokens   : ~120,000
   Request size       : ~420.5 KB

   Proceed? [y/N]
   ```
3. If confirmed, the tool retrieves API keys and begins summarization. Otherwise, it exits gracefully.
4. If `--force` is used, the confirmation prompt is automatically bypassed.

### 🔍 Dry Run Mode

You can run `repo2readme` in `--dry-run` mode to preview the analysis, view the estimated tokens, and verify your include/exclude filters without making any LLM requests or requiring API keys:

```bash
repo2readme run --local ./path/to/your/repo --dry-run
```

Output example:
```
Repository Tree

project/
├── src/
├── tests/
└── README.md

Files to be processed

✓ src/main.py
✓ src/api.py
✓ tests/test_api.py
...

Repository Analysis

Files selected     : 45
Estimated tokens   : ~120,000
Request size       : ~420.5 KB

Dry run complete.
No API requests were made.
```

### 2. Reset API Keys

To clear your stored Groq and Google Gemini API keys:
```bash
repo2readme reset
```
This will delete the configuration file storing your keys, prompting   
you to re-enter them on the next `run` command.

## Configuration

`repo2readme` requires API keys for Groq and Google Gemini to interact 
with large language models. These keys can be provided either as       
environment variables or will be prompted for and saved locally.       

### API Keys

*   **GROQ_API_KEY**: Required for accessing the Groq LLM (used for    
file summarization).
*   **GOOGLE_API_KEY**: Required for accessing Google Generative AI    
(Gemini) models (used for README generation and review).

When `repo2readme run` is executed for the first time or if keys are   
missing, the CLI will interactively prompt you to enter them. These    
keys are then saved in a JSON file at `~/.repo2readme_env.json` for    
future use.

Alternatively, you can set these as system environment variables:      
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"
```

## How It Works

The `repo2readme` tool orchestrates a sophisticated workflow to        
generate a README:

1.  **Repository Loading**:
    *   Based on your input (GitHub URL or local path), a `RepoLoader` 
determines whether to use a `UrlRepoLoader` (which clones the GitHub   
repository into a temporary directory) or a `LocalRepoLoader` (which   
reads from your local filesystem).
    *   During loading, an intelligent filter (`github_file_filter`) is
applied to ignore irrelevant files and directories (e.g., `.git`,      
`node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, `.env`, various binary or data    
files), focusing only on source code and essential project files.      

2.  **Repository Structure & File Analysis**:
    *   A visual directory tree (`generate_tree`) is constructed,      
providing a clear overview of the project's structure.
    *   For each relevant file, its programming language is detected   
(`detect_lang`) based on its extension.
    *   A `summarize_file` function is then invoked, which uses a      
specialized LangChain chain powered by the **Groq LLM
(openai/gpt-oss-120b)** to generate a concise, JSON-formatted summary  
of the file's content and purpose. This summary is tailored for README 
generation.

3.  **Iterative README Generation Workflow**:
    *   The core of the README creation is handled by a **LangGraph    
state machine**. This machine iteratively generates, reviews, and      
refines the README.
    *   **Generation Node**: The `generate_readme_node` utilizes a     
**Google Gemini 2.5 Flash model** via LangChain. It takes all file     
summaries, the repository tree structure, any previous `README` 
content, and reviewer feedback to produce a new `README.md` draft.     
    *   **Review Node**: The `readme_reviewer_node` also uses a        
**Google Gemini 2.5 Flash model**. This agent evaluates the latest     
README draft, assigns it a quality score (1-10), and provides
constructive feedback for improvement.
    *   **Conditional Loop**: The workflow continues looping between   
generation and review. The process stops when the generated `README`   
achieves a score of 8.5 or higher, or if a maximum number of iterations
is reached, ensuring a high-quality output while preventing infinite   
loops.

4.  **Output**:
    *   The best-scoring `README.md` generated during the iterative    
process is selected.
    *   This final `README` content is then either printed to the      
console or saved to the specified output file (defaulting to
`README.md`).

Throughout this process, `repo2readme/config.py` manages the secure    
loading and saving of API keys, prompting the user for input if        
necessary. Temporary directories created during remote repository      
cloning are also safely cleaned up using `force_remove`.

### Configurable File Filtering

Repo2Readme uses default filters to skip generated files, build artifacts, lock files, images, archives, and other files that are usually not useful for README generation.

You can include or exclude additional files using glob patterns:

```bash
repo2readme run --local ./my-project --include "package.json"
repo2readme run --local ./my-project --exclude "tests/*"
repo2readme run --local ./my-project --include "*.json" --max-file-size-kb 200
```
...
